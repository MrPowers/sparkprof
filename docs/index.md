# Welcome to SparkProf

This guide will teach you how to use Spark.

Spark is a great compute engine for both small and large data workflows.  It works well on a localhost, single node machine or in the cloud on a distributed cluster.

Spark has many advantages over other compute engines:

* fast performance
* full SQL support
* streaming APIs
* build-in machine learning capabilities
